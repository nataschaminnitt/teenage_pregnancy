    "# FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN’S HIV, GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH STATUS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Teenage pregnancy and motherhood have been a major health and social concern in Uganda as it infringes upon the human rights of girls but also hinders their ability to achieve their full socioeconomic development. Teenagers who engage in sexual intercourse at a young age face an elevated risk of becoming pregnant and giving birth. The 2022 UDHS indicated that 23.5% of women age 15-19 had initiated childbearing by the time of the survey, with 18.4% having already had a live birth, while 5.1% were pregnant with their first child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns by background characteristics:\n",
    "* By age 16, 1 in every 10 women age 15-19 has begun childbearing. This percentage significantly rises to almost 4 out of every 10 by the time they reach 18 (Table 5.12).\n",
    "* Teenagers in rural areas started childbearing earlier than those in urban areas. Twenty five percent of women age 15-19 in rural areas have begun childbearing, compared with 21% in urban areas.\n",
    "* Teenage childbearing varies by region. The percentage of women age 15-19 who have begun childbearing ranges from 15% in Kigezi region to 28 % -30% in Busoga and Bukedi sub regions.\n",
    "* The proportion of women age 15-19 who have begun childbearing decreases with both education and wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regions: The selection of the districts that we surveyed was informed by HIV prevalence dynamics and implementing partner support: we went to districts where there were Global Fund-supported implementing partners working to reduce the new number of new HIV infections among AGYW, improve SRH (e.g. reduce teenage pregnancy) and GBV indicators in the targeted districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",

    "The output of this notebook includes a data analysis responding to the research questions."

    "Sample: Between group (been pregnant = 1,925 | Not been pregnant = 1,513)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "* Girls in the Medium wealth group have odds of teenage pregnancy that are 44% of the odds for girls in the Low wealth group. This implies a 56% reduction in odds compared to the reference group (since 1 - 0.44 = 0.56).\n",
    "* Girls in the High wealth group have odds of teenage pregnancy that are only 11% of those for girls in the Low wealth group—a reduction of 89% (1 - 0.11 = 0.89).\n",
    "* This model clearly shows a gradient in risk: as wealth increases, the odds of teenage pregnancy decrease significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls:\n",
    "* Nearly everyone has the same value (e.g., 97% attend school), the control adds little and can cause numerical issues.\n",
    "* Given that almost all girls who have been married tend to experience teenage pregnancy afterwards, using the marriage variable to predict pregnancy across groups can lead to separation issues and isn’t as informative.\n",
    "* Household vulnerability was not a significant predictor."
