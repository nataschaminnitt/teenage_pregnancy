    "# FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN’S HIV, GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH STATUS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Teenage pregnancy and motherhood have been a major health and social concern in Uganda as it infringes upon the human rights of girls but also hinders their ability to achieve their full socioeconomic development. Teenagers who engage in sexual intercourse at a young age face an elevated risk of becoming pregnant and giving birth. The 2022 UDHS indicated that 23.5% of women age 15-19 had initiated childbearing by the time of the survey, with 18.4% having already had a live birth, while 5.1% were pregnant with their first child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns by background characteristics:\n",
    "* By age 16, 1 in every 10 women age 15-19 has begun childbearing. This percentage significantly rises to almost 4 out of every 10 by the time they reach 18 (Table 5.12).\n",
    "* Teenagers in rural areas started childbearing earlier than those in urban areas. Twenty five percent of women age 15-19 in rural areas have begun childbearing, compared with 21% in urban areas.\n",
    "* Teenage childbearing varies by region. The percentage of women age 15-19 who have begun childbearing ranges from 15% in Kigezi region to 28 % -30% in Busoga and Bukedi sub regions.\n",
    "* The proportion of women age 15-19 who have begun childbearing decreases with both education and wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regions: The selection of the districts that we surveyed was informed by HIV prevalence dynamics and implementing partner support: we went to districts where there were Global Fund-supported implementing partners working to reduce the new number of new HIV infections among AGYW, improve SRH (e.g. reduce teenage pregnancy) and GBV indicators in the targeted districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",

    "The output of this notebook includes a data analysis responding to the research questions."

    "Research question: Among girls who experienced a teenage pregnancy, what factors predict who drops out versus completes (or stays in) school?\n",
    "* This model examines differences in dropout among girls who have had a teenage pregnancy, with a special focus on the timing of marriage (whether they married before or after the pregnancy) rather than just a binary \"pregnant\" indicator. The idea is to understand variation within the pregnant group rather than comparing pregnant to non-pregnant girls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample:\n",
    "* Girls who experienced a teenage pregnancy (pregnancy at ≤ 19).\n",
    "* Outcome: School dropout (dropped_out).\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors/Controls:\n",
    "Marital Status (Timing):\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation: \n",
    "* Marital Status: Among girls who experienced a teenage pregnancy, being married (either before or after) is associated with substantially lower odds of school dropout compared to those who remain never married. Specifically, those who married after pregnancy have a 72% reduction (OR = 0.28) and those who married before have a 50% reduction (OR = 0.50) in dropout odds.\n",
    "* Household Wealth: Lower household wealth is associated with a markedly higher risk of dropout. Girls from Low wealth households have about 4 times the odds of dropping out (OR = 4.09), and those from Medium wealth households about 2.36 times the odds, compared to girls from High wealth households.\n",
    "* Age at Pregnancy and School Location: Age at pregnancy does not have a statistically significant effect in this model. School location (specifically category 2) shows a dramatic effect, but the estimates for school location, especially category 3, may be unstable and require further checking.\n",
    "* Model Fit and Considerations: The overall model has a pseudo R-squared of 0.0410, indicating that these predictors explain about 4.1% of the variation in dropout odds. While not very high, this is common in logistic regressions of behavioral outcomes."

    "**4. How do the age at first sexual intercourse and the context of that initial encounter (including consent, protective behavior, substance influence, and partner type) influence the risk of teenage pregnancy among Ugandan adolescent girls?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale and Variables\n",
    "* Age at First Sex (sex_age): Earlier sexual initiation is often associated with higher risk of teenage pregnancy.\n",
    "* Voluntariness (will_sex_binary): Whether the girl was willing to have sex may reflect her ability to negotiate safer behaviors.\n",
    "* Protective Behavior (do_anything): This variable can capture whether any contraception or precaution was taken during the first encounter.\n",
    "* Substance Influence (under_influe): Being under the influence may impair judgment and reduce the likelihood of using contraception.\n",
    "* Partner Type (person_sex): The type of partner (e.g., boyfriend, stranger, teacher) can provide insight into power dynamics and associated pregnancy risks.\n",
    "* Inclusion Criterion (life_sex): Restricting to those who have initiated sex ensures that you're looking at meaningful differences in the context of first sexual experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "* sex_age (OR = 0.92): For each additional year in age at first sexual intercourse, the odds of experiencing teenage pregnancy decrease by about 8% (p = 0.008).\n",
    "* will_sex_binary (OR = 1.45): Girls whose first sexual encounter was classified as “willing” have 1.45 times the odds of experiencing teenage pregnancy compared to girls who were not willing, holding other factors constant (p = 0.004)\n",
    "* do_anything_binary (OR = 0.36): Girls who reported taking some protective action (e.g., using a condom or other method) at their first sexual encounter have only 36% the odds of becoming pregnant compared to those who did not, meaning they have a 64% reduction in odds (p < 0.001).\n",
    "* partner_husband (OR = 3.49): If the first sexual partner was a husband (as opposed to the reference category—likely “boyfriend”), the odds of experiencing teenage pregnancy are 3.48 times as high (p < 0.001).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "* A later age at first sex significantly reduces the likelihood of teenage pregnancy.\n",
    "* Girls who report being willing at first sex have higher odds of teenage pregnancy.\n",
    "* Taking protective measures at first sex is strongly protective.\n",
    "* The type of partner matters greatly: having a husband as the first sexual partner is associated with a more than threefold higher risk of teenage pregnancy compared to a boyfriend, while first sex with a stranger appears to lower risk, though less robustly."

    "Results:\n",
    "* do_anything_binary (Early Contraceptive Use at First Sex) (OR = 3.07): Holding marital status and pregnancy concern constant, girls who reported taking any preventive action at their first sexual encounter have about 3.07 times the odds of sustained condom use compared to those who did not take any preventive action. This is a statistically significant effect (p < 0.001), suggesting that early initiation of contraceptive behavior is strongly associated with later sustained condom use.\n",
    "* been_married_binary (Marital Status) (OR = 1.02): Controlling for the other factors, girls who have ever been married have only 22% of the odds of sustained condom use compared to girls who have never been married. In other words, being married is associated with a substantial decrease (about 78% lower odds) in the likelihood of consistent condom use. This result is statistically significant (p < 0.001).\n",
    "* worry_preg_reverse (Pregnancy Concern) (OR = 1.02): The association between the level of pregnancy concern and sustained condom use is very weak and not statistically significant (p = 0.833). This suggests that, after accounting for the other predictors, how concerned a girl is about getting pregnant does not meaningfully predict whether she consistently uses condoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "* There is strong evidence that initiating contraceptive behavior at first sex (do_anything_binary) increases the odds of sustained condom use over a 12‑month period. Girls who took any preventive action at their first sexual encounter are more than three times as likely to report consistent condom use later.\n",
    "* Being married is associated with a much lower likelihood of sustained condom use. This could reflect that marriage may involve different dynamics around fertility intentions, where pregnancy might be more acceptable or even desired.\n",
    "* The level of concern about pregnancy (worry_preg_reverse) does not appear to significantly affect sustained condom use when other factors are taken into account."
